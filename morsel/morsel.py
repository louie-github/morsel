This script can either translate strings via a "naive" one-to-one
correspondence / mapping to International Morse Code signals, or by
following some of the standard's additional guidelines for the
transmission of certain sequences, e.g. transmitting the sequence 4%
as 4-0/0 and 5½‰ as 5-1/2-0/00, among other things.

However, this script *does not* claim compliance with the
aforementioned ITU-R M.1677 standard for International Morse Code, and
should not be construed or understood in any way to be as such.
